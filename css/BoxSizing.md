# Box Sizing

- `box-sizing: border-box` would account for any border and padding in the values you specify for width and height. The content box will shrink to absorb that extra width.
    - Recommended to apply `box:sizing: border-box` to all elements.
- By default, all elements's `box-sizing` is set to `content-box`
