# ðŸš€ Web and Mobile Resources ðŸš€

Guides, tutorials, articles, links, resources...whatever you wish to call it.

Since the start of February 2018, I began subscribing to publishing site like Smashing Magazine, HackerNoon, Medium, and freeCodeCamp. As more email messages flooded in with articles to read, I took time (lots of time) to absorb the information. In doing so, I thought that taking notes was fundamental to ensure I have the information locked down somewhere. I didn't want to be just a passive reader.

So ever since then, I frequently post Markdown documents to this repository and intentionally set this repository to public. I hope that by doing so other people will find the resources helpful in some ways. Please know that this repository will keep on expanding.

My notes aren't perfect. If you find any typo or parts with mistakes, please make a pull request. Thank you.
